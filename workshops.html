<p>As an experienced facilitator I enjoy working with groups of people, creating a positive learning environment. I have run workshops for public sector bodies as well as professional firms and universities. Areas covered have included the following:</p>
<table width="100%">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td style="text-align: left;" width="50%">
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Networking</span></li>
                    <li><span>Interview Techniques</span></li>
                    <li><span>How to find a job</span></li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td style="text-align: left;" width="50%">
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Soft skills</span></li>
                    <li><span>Career Planning</span></li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Workshops can be run as half or full days and I would recommend that the group is no larger than 10 people.</p>
