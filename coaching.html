<p>What is Coaching?</p>
<p>Coaching is goal focussed and measurable. It is not counselling. It's purpose is to enable you to be your best; overcoming issues which may be hindering performance by raising your own self awareness and working together to create effective options. There will be 4 stages to the process:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span>Agreeing the goal and identifying the steps that will need to be taken in order to achieve that goal.</span></li>
    <li><span>Looking at what is happening now and what has already been achieved.</span></li>
    <li><span>Working together to identify options and looking at the practicalities of those options.</span></li>
    <li><span>Devising an action plan.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Coaching has many benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span>Clarity around your own goals and how best to achieve them.</span></li>
    <li><span>Independent thinking and ultimately the ability to be your own coach.</span></li>
    <li><span>Motivation to move forwards.</span></li>
    <li><span>Overcoming issues that have been preventing positive action.</span></li>
    <li><span>Greater self-belief and a more positive outlook.</span></li>
    <li><span>Measurable outcomes.</span></li>
</ul>
