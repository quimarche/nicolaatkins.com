<p>Here are some of the tips I have picked up along the way. I hope they are of some use to you.</p>
<p>CVs</p>
<ul>
    <li><span>Have a profile on the top of your cv.</span></li>
    <li><span>Make sure it is factual and engages the reader.</span></li>
    <li><span>Avoid phrases such as "highly motivated" and "works well as part of a team and independantly".</span></li>
    <li><span>Avoid subjective statements.</span></li>
    <li><span>Put your job role in context, explaining which department you are based in, your overall responsibility and the size of your team.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Interviews</p>
<ul>
    <li><span>Find out the format.</span></li>
    <li><span>Find out who will be interviewing, checking job titles etc.</span></li>
    <li><span>Have a mock interview. It is the only way you will find out exactly how you come across and will give you the opportunity to try out your answers in a safe environment.</span></li>
    <li><span>Anticipate questions that might make you feel uncomfortable, and practice answers to them.</span></li>
    <li><span>Prepare examples to back up your skills, ensuring that your answers are structured and always demonstrate the result or benefit of your actions, if appropriate.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Job Search</p>
<ul>
    <li><span>Have a plan of action and always research your market place before you send your cv out.</span></li>
    <li><span>A high percentage of jobs are filled through word of mouth, so networking should be an essential part of your job search.</span></li>
    <li><span>Always send a covering letter/email with your cv and tailor it to the organization to whom you are writing. Do not fall into the trap of telling the reader what you want to tell them about yourself. Rather, highlight the key facts that will be of most interest to them.</span></li>
    <li><span>Build effective relationships with recruitment agencies. They are not your enemy, but in the current climate, have many candidates registered with them. So, you need to be clear about what you have to offer and how that fits in the market place.</span></li>
</ul>
