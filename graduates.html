<p>In the current highly competitive market place having a degree no longer guarantees you a job. Employers take into account work experience, extra-curricular activities and perhaps most importantly communication skills. From the minute you enter the job market you need to be clear about what your skills are, what you have to offer and what differentiates you from everyone else. Each step of the process, from application to interview needs to be handled with care and attention ensuring that everything you do is tailored to the job that you are applying for. Rejections are typically the result of applicants not spending sufficient time thinking about what the potential employer will be interested in. Equally failure at interview is usually the result of a lack of preparation. So if you are at the start of your job search or halfway through here are a few things to consider:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span>Be clear about the skills you have to offer and have examples to demonstrate these.</span></li>
    <li><span>Have a profile on your cv and ensure that it differentiates you from the crowd avoiding phrases such as "good communication skills" and "highly motivated".</span></li>
    <li><span>Do not use subjective statements on your cv or make any comments - stick to the facts.</span></li>
    <li><span>Research your career options thoroughly. Speak to someone who already does the job and gain work experience in the relevant area.</span></li>
    <li><span>Use examples wherever possible at interview. Ensure answers are structured using the Challenge, Action, Result (CAR) mnemonic.</span></li>
    <li><span>Have a mock interview.</span></li>
    <li><span>Find a mentor to provide an objective sounding board.</span></li>
</ul>
